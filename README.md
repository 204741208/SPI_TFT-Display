# SPI_TFT-Display

Implement the following task using HAL Programming, generate initialization and configuration code using Cube software:

Interface a 1.8 inch Color SPI TFT module (ST7735) with an STM32F401RBT6 controller.

The final output should print 'Kernel Masters' on the TFT screen.

Step 1: Study the ST7735 TFT module datasheet to understand specifications, communication protocols, and register programming.

Step 2: Download the ST7735 TFT module device driver from the internet and understand driver initialization, configuration, and operation functions.

Step 3: Modify the driver according to the Raayan mini board pin configuration, and also enable SPI mux configuration using Cube software.



Find the attached ST7735 datasheet for your reference.

Hint: There is no particular exam end time. If any five members got the results then we will stop the test.
